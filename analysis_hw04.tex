\medskip{\bf Problem 1}


The three properties of a metric are 1) $d(x,x)=0$, 2) $d(x,y)=d(y,x)$, and 3) $d(x,y)\leq d(x,z)+d(z,y)$.
$d(x,y)=\int_a^b|x(t)-y(t)|dt$ satisfies these properties.
Clearly property one is satisfied.
Property two follows from
$$d(x,y)=\int_a^b|x(t)-y(t)|dt=\int_a^b|-(y(t)-x(t))|dt=\int_a^b|y(t)-x(t)|dt=d(y,x)$$
and the third property of the metric follows from the triangle inequality
$$\eqalign{d(x,y)=\int_a^b|x(t)-y(t)|dt&=\int_a^b|x(t)-z(t)+z(t)-y(t)|dt\cr&\leq\int_a^b|x(t)-z(t)|dt+\int_a^b|z(t)-y(t)|dt=d(x,z)+d(y,z)}$$
So it is clear that $d(x,y)$ is a metric.
Therefore $(C[a,b], d)$ is a metric space.\hfill\qed


\medskip{\bf Problem 2}


The three properties required to show $\|\cdot\|_p$ is a norm on $\ell^p$ are 1) $\|x\|_p=0$ if and only if $x=0$, 2) that $\|\lambda x\|_p=|\lambda|\|x\|_p$, and 3) that that triangle inequality is satisfied: $\|x+y\|_p\leq\|x\|_p+\|y\|_p$.


Because the norm is a series of non-negative elements $|\xi_i|$, a norm of 0 implies that all of the elements are zero.
And if all of the elements $\xi_i=0$, the norm on $\ell_p$ will be zero as well.
So the first property is satisfied.


The second property holds in a pretty straight forward manner as well
$$\|\lambda x\|_p=(\sum^\infty_{i=1}|\lambda\xi_i|^p)^{1/p}=(\sum^\infty_{i=1}|\lambda|^p|\xi_i|^p)^{1/p}=|\lambda|(\sum^\infty_{i=1}|\xi_i|^p)^{1/p}=|\lambda|\|x\|_p$$


The final property requires some leg work.
$$\eqalign{\|x+y\|_p^p&=\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\xi_i+\eta_i|^p\cr&=\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\xi_i+\eta_i||\xi_i+\eta_i|^{p-1}\cr&\leq\sum_{i=1}^\infty(|\xi_i|+|\eta_i|)|\xi_i+\eta_i|^{p-1}\cr}$$
where this last step follows from the triangle inequality for numbers.
Continuing,
$$\eqalign{&=\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\xi_i||\xi_i+\eta_i|^{p-1}+\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\eta_i||\xi_i+\eta_i|^{p-1}\cr&\leq(\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\xi_i|^p)^{1/p}(\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\xi_i+\eta_i|^{(p-1)({p\over p-1})})^{({p-1\over p})}+(\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\eta_i|^p)^{1/p}(\sum_{i=1}^\infty|\xi_i+\eta_i|^{(p-1)({p\over p-1})})^{({p-1\over p})}\cr&=(\|x\|_p+\|y\|_p){\|x+y\|_p^p\over\|x+y\|_p}}$$
H\"older's inequality was used to expand the sums in the second line.
Finally, the last statement is enough to prove Minkowski's inequality $\|x+y\|_p\leq\|x\|_p+\|y\|_p$.
But this is a statement of the triangle inequality for the norm $\|\cdot\|_p$, the final property of the norm.
Therefore $\|\cdot\|_p$ is a norm on $\ell^p$.\hfill\qed

{\bf Problem 3}


By definition, a Cauchy sequence is one for which for $\varepsilon>0$ there exist $m,n>N(\varepsilon)$ such that
$$d(x_m,x_n)\leq\varepsilon$$
It is given that $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a subsequence converging to $x\in X$, or that for some $\varepsilon>0$,
$$d(x_{n_k},x)\leq\varepsilon\eqno(*)$$
Given the previous two statements, we are required to show that
$$d(x_n,x)\leq\varepsilon\eqno(1)$$
Rewriting (1) as $d(x_n,x)\leq d(x_n,x_{n_k}) + d(x_{n_k},x)$, ($*$) informs me that the second term on the right hand side can be made smaller than $\varepsilon$ with a suitable choice of $N$.
Likewise, since $n_k$ increases with $k$, we can select a $k$ such that the first term is arbirarily small, because it will behave ``Cauchily''
$$d(x_n,x_{n_k})\leq\varepsilon$$
Therefore, we choose $C=\max(n_k,N)$ and for this choice let $n\geq C$ so that $d(x_n,x)<2\varepsilon$.
Since $\varepsilon>0$ can be made as small as necessary, it is clear that (1) holds.
This is the required result.\hfill\qed
